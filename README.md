# Linode OpenAPI 3 Schema

This is the API V4 OpenAPI 3 Schema

## Development

I recommend [Swagger Editor](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor) for
development.  You can either download the application, or clone the linked repo
and run `npm start` to launch it (or use the online version even).  Once in the
editor, use the File menu to Import the swagger.yaml file in this directory and
start editing!
