  title: Linode API
  description: |
    This is Linode's next generation API. The API was designed around the concepts of REST and does
    its best to conform to a RESTful model whenever possible. When not possible the goal was to be
    as intuitive as possible.

    Another design goal of the Linode API was to give developers the power to manipulate all Linode
    services through code as easily as they can through the Linode Manager UI.

    With this API, it is now not only possible to create a new Linode, but also enable backups,
    add it to a Nodebalancer, attach Block Storage Volumes, create backup snapshots, imagize its
    disk for mass deployment of more Linodes, and so much more.

    Additionally, as an administrator on an account, you can now use the API to create new users and
    control the level of access they have to the services on your account.

    Finally, one of the most powerful features of this version of Linode's API is the ability to
    allow third-party applications control of your account through the OAuth 2 protocol. All Linode
    service endpoints allow four levels of access: __view__, __create__, __modify__, __delete__.
    Developers now have the capability to create their own exciting new services on top of Linode's
    world-class infrastructure.

      summary: Create Linode
      description: |
        This endpoint allows you to create a new Linode server on your account. In order for this
        request to complete successfully, your user must have the `add_linodes` grant. Creating a
        new Linode will incur a charge on your account.

        Linodes can be created using one of the available types. See `GET /linode/types` to get more
        information about each type's specs and cost.

        Linodes can be created in any one of our available regions, see `GET /regions` for a list
        of available regions you deploy your Linode in.

        Linodes can be created in a number of ways:

        - Using a Linode Linux Distribution image or an image you created based on another Linode
          - The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`
          - A default config with two disks, one being a 512 swap disk, is created
            - `swap_size` can be used to customize the swap disk size
          - Requires a `password` be supplied to use for the root user's account
          - It is recommended to supply ssh keys for the root user using the `authorized_keys` field

        - Using one of your own StackScripts or a public StackScript
          - The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`
          - Requires a compatible Linode Linux Distribution `image` to be supplied
            - see `GET /linode/stackscript/{stackscriptId}` for compatible images
          - Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root user's account
          - It is recommended to supply ssh keys for the root user using the `authorized_keys` field

        - Using one of your other Linode's backups
          - The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`
          - The disks and config will match that of the Linode that was backed up
          - The `root_pass` will match that of the Linode that was backed up

        - Create an empty Linode
          - The Linode will remain `offline` and must be manually started
            - see `POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/boot`
          - Disks and Configs must be created manually
          - This is only recommended for advanced use-cases

                    `read_write` access to that Linode, the backup must have a `status` of
                    `successful`, and the Linode must be deployed to the same `region` as the backup.
                    See `GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/backups` for a Linode's available backups.

                    enrolled in the Linode Backup service. This will incur an additional charge.
                    The cost for the Backup service is dependent on the type of Linode deployed.

        attributes. Additionally:

        A Personal Access Token is a token generated manually to access the API
        without going through an OAuth login.  Personal Access Tokens can have
