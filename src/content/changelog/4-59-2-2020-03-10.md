Some heuristics for which heading to put API reference updates under:

_Added_

* New endpoints.
* New fields in the request or a response of an existing endpoint.

_Changed_

* Changes in the behavior of an existing endpoing, when the previous behavior was working as it was designed. In other words, non-bugfix changes.

_Fixes_

* Bugfixes: Changes to the behavior of an endpoint, where the previous behavior was not working as intended/expected/documented.

<!-- Sample syntax - delete this before merging -->

* References to an endpoint should be in this format: `the Endpoint Name ([VERB /path/to/endpoint/{endpointVariable}](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4/{endpoint}/{#endpointVariable})) endpoint` _Example_: `the Clone Linode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-clone/#post)) endpoint`

### Version Change Notes

The previous API release was assigned version number 4.14.1, while this release is tagged 4.59.2. This is an intentional change to align with internal version numbers. Subsequent releases will continue following the [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning specification.

### Added

* Added `updated` and `created` read-only fields to DomainRecord objects.
  * Use the [Domain Records collection](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/domains-domain-id-records) to review your DomainRecord objects.
* Added the List Object Storage Buckets in Cluster ([GET /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}](/api/v4/object-storage-buckets-cluster-id)) endpoint.
  * This endpoint returns a list of Buckets in a specific cluster that belong to the user's Account.
* When cloning a Linode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-clone/#post)), any tags existing on the source Linode will be cloned to the target Linode.

### Changed

* Updated the Linode Status field to include `stopped`. This status will occur when your Linode goes into maintenance mode. 
  * Use the [Linode Instances collection endpoints](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances) to review the Linode Status field.

### Fixed
