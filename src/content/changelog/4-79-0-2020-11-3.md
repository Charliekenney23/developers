### Added

- Added the [Object Storage Object ACL View](http://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-object-acl-config-view) (GET /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}/{bucket}/object-acl) endpoint. This endpoint returns an Object's currently configured Access Control List (ACL) within a specific bucket. ACLs define who can access your buckets and objects and specify the level of access granted to those users.

- Added the [Object Storage Object ACL Update](http://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-object-acl-config-update) (PUT /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}/{bucket}/object-acl) endpoint. This endpoint update's an Object's currently configured Access Control List (ACL) within a specific bucket. ACLs define who can access your buckets and objects and specify the level of access granted to those users.

- Added the [Object Storage Bucket Access Update](http://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-bucket-access-update) (PUT /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}/{bucket}/access) endpoint. Use this endpoint to update a bucket's basic Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Access Control Level (ACL) settings.

- Added the [Object Storage Transfer View](http://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-object-acl-config-view) (GET /object-storage/transfer) endpoint. This endpoint returns the amount of outbound data transfer used by your account's Object Storage buckets. Object Storage adds 1 terabyte of outbound data transfer to your data transfer pool. See the [Object Storage Pricing and Limitations](http://www.linode.com/docs/guides/pricing-and-limitations/) guide for details on Object Storage transfer quotas.

- Added the `objects` field to the following Object Storage endpoints:

    - [Object Storage Buckets List](http://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-buckets-list) (GET /object-storage/buckets)
    - [Object Storage Buckets in Cluster List](http://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-buckets-in-cluster-list) (GET /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId})
    - [Object Storage Bucket View](http://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-bucket-view) (GET /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}/{bucket})

    The `object` field returns the number of objects stored in a bucket.

### Fixed

- Error messages for Firewall endpoints have been improved. When applicable, they now return a [Firewall Device's](http://www.linode.com/docs/api/networking/#firewall-device-create) `label` and `id`.

- Fixed the [Ticket Attachment Create](http://www.linode.com/docs/api/support/#ticket-attachment-create) (POST /support/tickets/{ticketId}/attachments) endpoint's SHELL example with the correct way to attach a file when creating a support ticket.
