<!-- API changelog requirements - delete this before merging -->
- Replace all instances of X.X.X in the frontmatter with the appropriate API spec.
- Replace all instances of 2019-01-01 with the production release date for the API.
- All items in the changelog should mention which endpoints are affected.
- For changes and bugfixes, describe the previous behavior AND the new behavior.

<!-- Where to put things - delete this before merging -->
Some heuristics for which heading to put API reference updates under:

*Added*
- New endpoints.
- New fields in the request or a response of an existing endpoint.

*Changed*
- Changes in the behavior of an existing endpoing, when the previous behavior was working as it was designed. In other words, non-bugfix changes.

*Fixes*
- Bugfixes: Changes to the behavior of an endpoint, where the previous behavior was not working as intended/expected/documented.

<!-- Sample syntax - delete this before merging -->

- References to an endpoint should be in this format: `the Endpoint Name ([VERB /path/to/endpoint/{endpointVariable}](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4/{endpoint}/{#endpointVariable})) endpoint` *Example*: `the Clone Linode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-clone/#post)) endpoint`

### Added
- The `View Account` ([GET /account](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4/account)) and the `Update Account` ([PUT /account](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4/account)) endpoints have been updated to include a new field `euuid`. This field is an external unique indentifier for this customer.

- The following endpoints have the new field `last_successful` adedd to the `backups` envelope within the `Linode` object. This field is the date and time of the last successful backup if there was one. If there was no backup, 'None' is shown.
    - `List Linodes` ([GET /linode/instances](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4/linode/instances))
    - `Create Linode` ([PUT /linode/instances](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4/linode/instances))
