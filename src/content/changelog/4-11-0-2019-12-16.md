### Added

- Added the `eol` field to images endpoints, List Images (GET /images/), Create Image (POST /images/) , View Image (GET /images/{imageId}), and Update Image (PUT /images/{imageId}). The eol field will display the date of the image's planned end of life. Some images, like custom private images, will not have an end of life date. If that is the case, the property will be empty.

- Added `last successful` field to the following endpoints:

	- List Linodes: GET /linode/instances
	- Create Linode: PUT /linode/instances
	- View Linode: GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}
	- Update Linode: PUT /linode/instances/{linodeId}
	- Rebuild Linode: POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/rebuild

This will list the date and time of the last successful backup. The field will return `none` if there was no previous backup.

- Added `euuid` field to Account endpoints, Update Account (PUT /account), and View Account (GET /account). `euuid` is a unique external identifier for each account.
