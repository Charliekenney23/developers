- API

### Added

- New endpoints.
- New fields in the request or a response of an existing endpoint.

### Changed

- Changes in the behavior of an existing endpoing, when the previous behavior was working as it was designed. In other words, non-bugfix changes.

### Fixed

- Previously, you could initiate a cross data center (DC) migration ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/migrate](/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-migrate/#post)) even if the Linode already had a pending migration in the queue. Now, if your Linode has a pending migration already queued, you will not be able to initiate a DC migration until it has completed and you will receive an error response, "Linode has a pending migration."  A list of pending migrations, if any, can be accessed from [GET /account/notifications](/api/v4/account-notifications ).

- Validation to ensure a running Linode is powered down prior to initiating a cross data center (DC) migration ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/migrate](/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-migrate/#post)) was removed. This validation is unnecessary because a Linode is automatically powered off, migrated, and then restored to its previous boot state when any Linode migration is initiated.
