### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
- A bug was fixed that would result in a 500 error when filtering domain records by an invalid tag on the ([ GET /domains/{domainId}/records](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/domains-domain-id-records)) endpoint. This will now return a 200 empty pagination result. 
- Previously, NS and CNAME records could be created for each other, resulting in errors. If this is attempted now, the record creation will fail with a "Record conflict" message.
- Changes were made to the ([GET /linode/instances](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances)) endpoint to improve response time.
