### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
- A bug was fixed that would result in a 500 error when filtering domain records by a non-existent tag. This will now return an empty 200 respone. 
- Previously, NS and CNAME records could be created for eachother, resulting in errors. If this is attempted now, the record creation will fail with a "Record conflict" message.
- Changes were made to the ([GET /linode/instances](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances) endpoint to improve response time.
