### Added

- The `managed_issue` field was added to the Open Support Ticket endpoint ([POST /support/tickets](/api/v4/support-tickets/#post)).
    - This field designates if the Support ticket is in reference to a [Managed service](https://www.linode.com/products/managed/).

### Fixed

- A bug was fixed that was preventing initiation of cross-scheduled data center migrations.

-  If your account's Cloud Manager authentication type is set to a third party authentication (TPA) method,  `password_keys` can no longer be used as your `lish_auth_method` when updating your profile ([PUT /profile](/api/v4/profile/#put)).
    - To view this account's Cloud Manager `authentication_type` field, send a request to the [View Profile](/api/v4/profile) endpoint.
