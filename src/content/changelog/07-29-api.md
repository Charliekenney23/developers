### Fixed

- The *Execute Staged/Approved PayPal Payment* ([POST /account/payments/paypal/execute](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/executePayPalPayment)) endpoint will return a more helpful error message whenever PayPal's services are temporarily unavailable.

- The entity field for an *ipaddress_update* event is now populated; it was previously null. Events are returned by the *List Events* ([GET /account/events](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/getEvents)) and *View Event* ([GET /account/events/:event_id](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/getEvent)) endpoints.

- The entity field for an *account_update* event is now populated; it was previously null. Events are returned by the *List Events* ([GET /account/events](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/getEvents)) and *View Event* ([GET /account/events/:event_id](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/getEvent)) endpoints.

- Calling the *Update Profile* endpoint ([PUT /profile](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/updateProfile)) without specifying an email in your request could previously trigger a notification email. This notification's message stated that your email address had been updated, even though it was not changed. This will no longer occur.

- Previously, if the *Create Disk* ([POST /linode/instances/:linode_id/disks](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/addLinodeDisk)) or *Create Linode* ([POST /linode/instances](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/createLinodeInstance)) endpoints were called with a custom image and with a list for the *authorized_users* field, then those authorized users' keys were not configured for the root user of the new disk or Linode. Those keys will now be properly configured on the provisioned disk.
