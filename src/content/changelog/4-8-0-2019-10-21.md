<!-- API changelog requirements - delete this before merging -->

* Replace all instances of X.X.X in the frontmatter with the appropriate API spec.
* Replace all instances of 2019-01-01 with the production release date for the API.
* All items in the changelog should mention which endpoints are affected.
* For changes and bugfixes, describe the previous behavior AND the new behavior.

<!-- Where to put things - delete this before merging -->

Some heuristics for which heading to put API reference updates under:

_Added_

* New endpoints.
* New fields in the request or a response of an existing endpoint.

_Changed_

* Changes in the behavior of an existing endpoing, when the previous behavior was working as it was designed. In other words, non-bugfix changes.

_Fixes_

* Bugfixes: Changes to the behavior of an endpoint, where the previous behavior was not working as intended/expected/documented.

<!-- Sample syntax - delete this before merging -->

* References to an endpoint should be in this format: `the Endpoint Name ([VERB /path/to/endpoint/{endpointVariable}](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4/{endpoint}/{#endpointVariable})) endpoint` _Example_: `the Clone Linode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-clone/#post)) endpoint`

### Added

* Added [POST /object-storage/cancel](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4beta/object-storage-cancel/#post) endpoint.
  * This endpoint allows you to remove Object Storage from an account. All buckets must be empty in order to use this endpoint.

### Changed

* The `View Account Settings ([GET /account/settings](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-settings)) endpoint` has been updated to include the status of this account's Object Storage Service. The possible values for this status are, `disabled`, `suspended`, and `active`.

### Fixed
