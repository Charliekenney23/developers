### Added

- The IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the DNS resolvers for a region are now accessible at the View Region ([GET /regions/{regionId}](api/v4/regions-region-id)) endpoint.

### Changed

- Changing your Longview subscription is no longer available at the Update Account Settings ([PUT /account/settings](/api/v4/account-settings/#put)) endpoint. Accordingly, the `longview_subscription` property has been removed from the Update Account Settings request body.

- Updated the description and response for the View Longview Plan ([GET /longview/plan](/api/v4/longview-plan)) endpoint:
  - The description has been corrected to state that the response consists of a LongviewSubscription object for your current Longview Pro plan, or an empty set `{}` if your current plan is Longview Free.
  - The response body and sample have been updated to include the details of the returned LongviewSubscription object for your current Longview plan.

- Updated the description, request, and response for the Update Longview Plan ([PUT /longview/plan](/api/v4/longview-plan/#put)) endpoint:
  - The description has been corrected to state that the response consists of a LongviewSubscription object for the updated Longview Pro plan, or an empty set {} if the updated plan is Longview Free.
  - The request body schema has been updated to specify possible values for the `longview_subscription` field and to reflect that it is nullable, with a `null` value corresponding to Longview Free.
  - The response body and sample have been updated to include the details of the returned LongviewSubscription object.

- Updated the response for the List Longview Subscriptions ([GET /longview/subscription](/api/v4/longview-subscriptions)) and View Longview Subscription ([GET /longview/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}](/api/v4/longview-subscriptions-subscription-id)) endpoint:
  - The response `id` property has been revised to specify possible values.

### Fixed

- A bug that prevented the Update Longview Plan ([PUT /longview/plan](/api/v4/longview-plan/#put)) endpoint from functioning has been fixed. The endpoint will now update your account's Longview plan as expected.
