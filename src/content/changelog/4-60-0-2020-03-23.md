<!-- API changelog requirements - delete this before merging -->
- Replace all instances of X.X.X in the frontmatter with the appropriate API spec.
- Replace all instances of 2019-01-01 with the production release date for the API.
- All items in the changelog should mention which endpoints are affected.
- For changes and bugfixes, describe the previous behavior AND the new behavior.

<!-- Where to put things - delete this before merging -->
Some heuristics for which heading to put API reference updates under:

*Added*
- New endpoints.
- New fields in the request or a response of an existing endpoint.

*Changed*
- Changes in the behavior of an existing endpoing, when the previous behavior was working as it was designed. In other words, non-bugfix changes.

*Fixes*
- Bugfixes: Changes to the behavior of an endpoint, where the previous behavior was not working as intended/expected/documented.

<!-- Sample syntax - delete this before merging -->

- References to an endpoint should be in this format: `the Endpoint Name ([VERB /path/to/endpoint/{endpointVariable}](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4/{endpoint}/{#endpointVariable})) endpoint` *Example*: `the Clone Linode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-clone/#post)) endpoint`

### Added

- The field `authentication_type` has been added to View Profile ([GET /profile](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/profile)) and Update Profile ([PUT /profile](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/profile/#put)). Authentication types are chosen through Cloud Manager and authorized through Login. These authentication types are either the user's password (in conjunction with their username), or the name of their indentity provider such as "github", "google", etc. For example:
  - If a user has never used Third-Party Authentication, their authentication type will be "password".
  - If a user is using Third-Party Authentication, their authentication type will be the name of their Identity Provider (eg. "github").
  - If a user used Third-Party Authentication and has since revoked it, their authentication type will be "password".
