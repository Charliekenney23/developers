_Fixes_

* Previously, the API reference noted that the `last_successful` property of a Linode's `backups` property would return `None` if no backup had been completed for that Linode. The API actually returns `null` under this circumstance, and the API reference has been updated to reflect this.
  * Use the List Linodes ([GET /linode/instances](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances)) endpoint to list all of your Linodes, and use the View Linode ([GET /linode/instances/{instanceID}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id)) endpoint to view a single Linode.
