### Fixed

- A bug was fixed to allow preservation of URL parameters for service monitor addresses set at the following endpoints:

  - [Managed Service Create](/docs/api/managed/#managed-service-create) (POST /managed/services)
  - [Managed Service Update](/docs/api/managed/#managed-service-update) (PUT /managed/services/{serviceId})
