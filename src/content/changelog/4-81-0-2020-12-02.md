### Fixed

- A bug was fixed to allow preservation of URL parameters for service monitor addresses set at the following endpoints:

  - [Managed Service Create](/docs/api/managed/#managed-service-create) (POST /managed/services)
  - [Managed Service Update](/docs/api/managed/#managed-service-update) (PUT /managed/services/{serviceId})

- [OAuth Reference](/docs/api/#oauth-reference) has been updated to include Firewall, Maintenance, and Object Storage security scopes.

- The OAuth scope for the [Firewalls List](/docs/api/networking/#firewalls-list) (GET /networking/firewalls) endpoint has been correct to `firewall:read_only`. Previously, it was stated as `firewalls:read_only`.
