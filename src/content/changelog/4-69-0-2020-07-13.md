### Added

- A `disks` field was added to the [Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)](/api/v4/lke-clusters) collection. This field allows you to define a custom disk layout for the nodes in a cluster's [Node Pool](/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools/#post). A custom disk layout is only required for specific use cases. If this field is omitted, the nodes in a Node Pool will have a default disk layout consisting of a single partition. The `disks` field is available from the following endpoints:

    - Create Kubernetes Cluster ([POST /lke/clusters](/api/v4/lke-clusters/#post)).
    - Create Node Pool ([POST /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools](/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools/#post))
    - View Node Pool ([GET /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}](/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools-pool-id))

### Changed

- Error handling for _ssl_cert_ and _ssl_key_ values related to NodeBalancer Config Create ([POST /nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/nodebalancers-node-balancer-id-configs/#post)) and Update Config ([PUT nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs/{configId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/nodebalancers-node-balancer-id-configs-config-id/#put)) endpoints has been updated. Error messages will now explain if a provided key is in an incorrect format.

- URLS added to the Create Managed Service ([POST/managed/services](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/managed-services/#post)) and Update Managed Service ([PUT /managed/services/{serviceId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/managed-services-service-id/#put)) may now include additional special characters.

### Fixed

- A bug was fixed that could result in a race condition to the Create User ([POST /account/users](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-users/#post)) endpoint if two identical users were created at the same time.- A bug was fixed that prevented users from adding or editing endpoints in the Tags collection on resources that they had edit permissions for.
