### Added

### Changed
* Error handling for _ssl_cert_ and _ssl_key_ values related to Nodebalancer Config Create ([POST /nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/nodebalancers-node-balancer-id-configs/#post)) and Update Config  __ ([PUT /nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs/{configId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/nodebalancers-node-balancer-id-configs-config-id/#put)) endpoints has been updated. Error messages will now explain if a provided key is in an incorrect format.
### Fixed
* A bug was fixed that could result in a race condition to the Create User ([POST /account/users](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-users/#post)) endpoint if two identical users were created at the same time.* A bug was fixed that prevented users from adding or editing tags on resources they had edit permissions for.
