### Changed

- Error handling for _ssl_cert_ and _ssl_key_ values related to NodeBalancer Config Create ([POST /nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/nodebalancers-node-balancer-id-configs/#post)) and Update Config ([PUT nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs/{configId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/nodebalancers-node-balancer-id-configs-config-id/#put)) endpoints has been updated. Error messages will now explain if a provided key is in an incorrect format.

- URLS added to the Create Managed Service ([POST/managed/services](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/managed-services/#post)) and Update Managed Service ([PUT /managed/services/{serviceId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/managed-services-service-id/#put)) may now include additional special characters.

### Fixed

- A bug was fixed that could result in a race condition to the Create User ([POST /account/users](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-users/#post)) endpoint if two identical users were created at the same time.- A bug was fixed that prevented users from adding or editing endpoints in the Tags collection on resources that they had edit permissions for.
