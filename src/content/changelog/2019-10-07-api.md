<!-- API changelog requirements - delete this before merging -->
- Replace all instances of X.X.X in the frontmatter with the appropriate API spec.
- Replace all instances of 2019-01-01 with the production release date for the API.
- All items in the changelog should mention which endpoints are affected.
- For changes and bugfixes, describe the previous behavior AND the new behavior.
<!-- Where to put things - delete this before merging -->
Some heuristics for which heading to put API reference updates under:

*Added*
- New endpoints.
- New fields in the request or a response of an existing endpoint.

*Changed*
- Changes in the behavior of an existing endpoing, when the previous behavior was working as it was designed. In other words, non-bugfix changes.

*Fixes*
- Bugfixes: Changes to the behavior of an endpoint, where the previous behavior was not working as intended/expected/documented.

<!-- Sample syntax - delete this before merging -->

- References to an endpoint should be in this format: `the Endpoint Name ([VERB /path/to/endpoint/{endpointVariable}](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4/{endpoint}/{#endpointVariable})) endpoint` *Example*: `the Clone Linode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-clone/#post)) endpoint`

### Added

* A `linode_reboot` Event action can now generate a `secondary_entity` object. A `secondary_entity` object displays information about an additional entity that is related to the Event.
    * Use the Accounts collection to List Events [GET /account/events](/api/v4/account-events) or to View an Event [GET /account/events/{eventId}](/api/v4/account-events-event-id).

* The List Managed Stats endpoint [GET managed/stats](/api/v4/managed-stats) returns a list of Managed Stats on your account in the form of y and x graph data points. These stats reflect the last 24 hours of combined usage for `cpu`, `disk`, `swap`, `network in`, and `network out`.
