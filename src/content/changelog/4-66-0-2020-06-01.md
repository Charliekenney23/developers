### Changed

- In an effort to fight spam, Linode restricts outbound connections on ports 25, 465, and 587 on all Linodes for new accounts created after November 5th, 2019. This is not a new change; however, this note now appears on the ([POST /linode/instances](/api/v4/linode-instances/#post)) endpoint.

- The upper limit for pagination can now be set to 500; the default remains 100. Read more about ([pagination](/api/v4/#pagination)).

- The CPU alert value defaults to 90% multiplied by the number of cores. This is not a new change; a note has been added to the ([Linode Instances](/api/v4/linode-instances)) group of endpoints.
