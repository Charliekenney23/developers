### Added

- Added the `Recycle Node Pool` ([POST /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}/recycle](/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools-pool-id-recycle/#post)) endpoint. This new endpoint allows you to recycle the Node Pool of your specified Kubernetes Cluster by `clusterId` and `poolId`.
- Added the `BETA List Maintenance` ([GET /account/maintenance](/api/v4/account-maintenance)) endpoint. This new beta endpoint allows you to view a collection of maintenance objects for any entity you have permissions to view. Currently, Linodes are the only entities availble for viewing.

### Changed

- Password validation is now solely reliant upon entropy (strength) score and no longer requires a set number of characters in special classes.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with domain validation where some multi-level domains were being flagged as invalid.

- Fixed a bug in CNAME record validation. It now checks all incoming CNAME records against all existing records (CNAME and otherwise) in this domain to make sure there are no conficts. Relevant endpoints:

    - `Create Domain Record` ([POST /domains/{domainId}/records](/api/v4/domains-domain-id-records/#post))
    - `Update Domain Record` ([PUT /domains/{domainId}/records/{recordId}](/api/v4/domains-domain-id-records-record-id/#put))
