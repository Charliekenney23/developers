### Added
- Added the `Enable Linode Managed` [POST /account/settings/managed-enable]() endpoint which enables Linode Managed for the entire account and sends a welcome email to the account’s associated email address. `Enable Linode Managed` can monitor any service or software stack reachable over TCP or HTTP.

### Changed
- Initiating a migration [POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/migrate]() now generates new, or updated, notifications available with [GET /account/notifications]() including:

  - Your Linode will soon be automatically powered off, migrated, and restored to its previous state (booted or powered off).
  
  - A notification which includes how many Linodes are in the queue ahead of this Linode. This position is dynamically generated, so if the notification is retrieved at an interval, it is always up-to-date.

### Fixed
- Previously, in the edge case where overwrite was set to true when restoring from backup (POST/linode/instances/{linodeId}/backups/{backupId}/restore), some disks were not being properly deleted. Additionally, the check to determine if there is enough disk size has been changed from checking the Linode’s `free_space` against the backup object’s `total_size` which is a computed value. This computed value is now being computed by summing the MinRestoreSize of each disk in the backup.

- Now, GET /support/tickets will properly honor the `order_by` `x-filter` query parameters.
