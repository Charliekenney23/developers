### Added

- Added the Update Managed Credential Username and Password ([POST /managed/credentials/{credentialId}/update](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/updateManagedCredentialUsernamePassword)) endpoint.

### Changed

- The maximum credit card payment that can be made with the Make Payment ([POST /account/payments](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/createPayment)) endpoint is $50,000. This value has not changed, but previously this endpoint would return an HTTP 500 error for payments over this amount. If a payment is attempted with this endpoint that exceeds this limit, an HTTP 400 error with a descriptive error message will now be returned.

- The number of concurrent clone operations for any given Linode is now limited to five clones. If a call to the Clone Linode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/cloneLinodeInstance)) endpoint would result in a sixth concurrent clone of a Linode, then the endpoint will return an HTTP 400 error with a descriptive error message.

### Fixed

- Previously, the *access* boolean of the *ssh* property of a Linode's Managed Settings would display *true* whenever Managed SSH access was disabled for the Linode, and *false* when it was enabled, contrary to the naming of the property. This property is returned by the List Managed Linode Settings ([GET /managed/linode-settings](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/getManagedLinodeSettings)) and View Linode's Managed Settings ([GET /managed/linode-settings/{linodeId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/getManagedLinodeSetting)) endpoints. This property will now correctly display *true* when Managed SSH access is enabled and *false* when Managed SSH access is disabled.

    Similarly, setting this property to *true* via the Update Linode's Managed Settings ([PUT /managed/linode-settings/{linodeId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/updateManagedLinodeSetting)) endpoint would result in Managed SSH access for the Linode being disabled, and setting it to *false* would result in Managed SSH access being enabled. This behavior is now reversed to align with the naming of the property.
